Dgraph client libraries allow you to run DQL transactions, queries and mutations
in various programming languages.

If you are interested in clients for GraphQL endpoint, please refer to
[GraphQL clients](/dgraph/graphql/connecting) section.

Go, python, Java, C# and JavaScript clients are using
**[gRPC](https://grpc.io/):** protocol and
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (the .proto
file used by Dgraph is located at
[api.proto](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgo/blob/main/protos/api.proto)).

A JavaScript client using **HTTP:** is also available.

It is possible to interface with Dgraph directly via gRPC or HTTP. However, if a
client library exists for your language, that's a simpler option.

<Tip>
  For multi-node setups, predicates are assigned to the group that first sees
  that predicate. Dgraph also automatically moves predicate data to different
  groups to balance predicate distribution. This occurs automatically every 10
  minutes. It is possible for clients to aid this process by communicating with
  all Dgraph instances. For the Go client, this means passing in one
  `*grpc.ClientConn` per Dgraph instance, or routing traffic through a load
  balancer. Mutations are made in a round robin fashion, resulting in a
  semi-random initial predicate distribution.

### Connection Strings

Most clients support opening communications to Dgraph clusters using connection
strings. Dgraph connections strings take the form
`dgraph://{username:password@}host:port?args`.

`username` and `password` are optional. If username is provided, a password must
also be present. If supplied, these credentials are used to log into a Dgraph
cluster through the ACL mechanism.

Valid connection string args:

| Arg         | Value                           | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apikey      | \<key\>                         | a Dgraph Cloud API Key                                                                                                                                        |
| bearertoken | \<token\>                       | an access token                                                                                                                                               |
| sslmode     | disable \| require \| verify-ca | TLS option, the default is `disable`. If `verify-ca` is set, the TLS certificate configured in the Dgraph cluster must be from a valid certificate authority. |

Note that using `sslmode=require` disables certificate validation and
significantly reduces the security of TLS. This mode should only be used in
non-production (e.g., testing or development) environments.

Some example connection strings:

| Value                                                                                                        | Explanation                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dgraph://localhost:9080                                                                                      | Connect to localhost, no ACL, no TLS                                                |
| dgraph://sally:supersecret@dg.example.com:443?sslmode=verify-ca                                              | Connect to remote server, use ACL and require TLS and a valid certificate from a CA |
| dgraph://foo-bar.grpc.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io:443?sslmode=verify-ca&apikey=\<your-api-connection-key\> | Connect to a Dgraph Cloud cluster                                                   |
| dgraph://foo-bar.grpc.hypermode.com?sslmode=verify-ca&bearertoken=\<some access token\>                      | Connect to a Dgraph cluster protected by a secure gateway                           |

See the various Dgraph client libraries for details on using connection strings.

### Transactions

Dgraph clients perform mutations and queries using transactions. A transaction
bounds a sequence of queries and mutations that are committed by Dgraph as a
single unit: that's, on commit, either all the changes are accepted by Dgraph or
none are.

A transaction always sees the database state at the moment it began, plus any
changes it makes --- changes from concurrent transactions aren't visible.

On commit, Dgraph aborts a transaction, rather than committing changes, when a
conflicting, concurrently running transaction has already been committed. Two
transactions conflict when both transactions:

- write values to the same scalar predicate of the same node (e.g both
  attempting to set a particular node's `address` predicate); or
- write to a singular `uid` predicate of the same node (changes to `[uid]`
  predicates can be concurrently written); or
- write a value that conflicts on an index for a predicate with `@upsert` set in
  the schema (see [upserts](/dgraph/dql/upsert)).

When a transaction is aborted, all its changes are discarded. Transactions can
be manually aborted.

  Clients](/dgraph/sdks/unofficial-clients).
