Dgraph is a graph database most commonly used for building knowledge graphs. It
is the only open, complete graph database used at terabyte-scale to power
real-time use cases.

## Start Building

Getting started with Dgraph is simple and straightforward.

Follow these steps to deploy your graph and run your first query. Use a
serverless graph on the Hypermode platform or start locally via Docker.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="On Hypermode">
    <Steps>

      <Step title="Sign in to Hypermode and create your first graph">
      Graphs on Hypermode provides a fully managed Dgraph service for building and deploying knowledge graphs.
       Learn more about Graphs on Hypermode in the [Hypermode Graphs documentation](/graphs/overview).

        To get started navigate to [`https://hypermode.com/sign-in`](https://hypermode.com/sign-in) and sign-in to Hypermode to create your account. You'll also be prompted to create a workspace and to create a graph.

        ![](/images/dgraph/overview/create-graph.png)

        After your graph is provisioned, you can select it from the Workspace overview page to view the details for your graph.

        ![](/images/dgraph/overview/workspace-overview.png)

        Here you can see the details for each graph, including the connection string and API Key used to connect to your graph.

        ![](/images/dgraph/overview/hypermode1.png)

        We'll use this connection string in the next step to connect our graph instance to the Ratel graph client and run our first query.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect Ratel">
        Ratel is a web-based UI dashboard for interacting with Dgraph using Dgraph's query language, [DQL](./glossary#DQL)
        We'll use Ratel to run our first query and visualize the results.

        Navigate to the hosted version of Ratel at [`https://ratel.hypermode.com`](https://ratel.hypermode.com) and enter your graph connection string from the previous step for the "Dgraph Alpha URL".
        This will allow Ratel to connect to your graph and execute DQL queries.


          ![](/images/dgraph/overview/hypermode-ratel-1.png)


      </Step>
      <Step title="Query your graph">
         Now we're ready to query our graph. We'll use a simple DQL query to verify Ratel is connected to our instance.

        Run the following query in Ratel:

        ```dql
        schema {}
        ```

        This will return a representation of the data stored in Dgraph, even if the graph is empty.

        Now that we've created a Hypermode Graph and run our first DQL query see [how to use DQL to create data in Dgraph,
        traverse the graph, and build applications using Dgraph clients](/dgraph/quickstart).

  <Tab title="Locally">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Run Dgraph with Docker">
        The [`dgraph/standalone`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgraph/standalone) Docker image has everything needed to run Dgraph locally.

        Ensure you have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/), then run the following command to start a local Dgraph instance:

        ```bash
        docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 dgraph/standalone:latest
        ```

        This will create a local Dgraph instance and expose the ports necessary to connect to Dgraph via HTTP and gRPC. Specifically:

        * `docker run` - initiates a new Docker container
        * `--rm` - automatically removes the container when it exits, helping with cleanup
        * `-it` - uses interactive mode to show output of the container
        * `-p 8080:8080` - maps port 8080 from the host machine to port 8080 in the Docker container to allow Dgraph HTTP connections
        * `-p 9080:9080` - maps port 9080 from the host machine to port 9080 in the Docker container to allow Dgraph gRPC connections
        * `dgraph/standalone:latest` - specifies the Docker image to use, this is the official Dgraph image with latest tag
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect Ratel">
        Ratel is a web-based UI dashboard for interacting with Dgraph using Dgraph's query language,[DQL](./glossary#DQL)

        Navigate to the hosted version of Ratel at `https://ratel.hypermode.com` and enter `http://localhost:8080` for the "Dgraph Alpha URL".
        This will allow Ratel to connect to our local Dgraph instance and execute DQL queries.

           ![Setting up Ratel](/images/dgraph/overview/ratel.png)

        <Note>
        You can also run Ratel locally by running the `dgraph/ratel` container with the following command:
        ```bash
        docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 dgraph/ratel:latest
        ```
        </Note>

      <Step title="Query your graph">
        Now we're ready to query our local Dgraph instance. We'll use a simple DQL query to verify Ratel is connected to our instance.
