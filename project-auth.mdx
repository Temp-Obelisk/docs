By default, Hypermode protects your project's endpoint with an API key, but you
can also bring your own auth too.

## Retrieve API Key

To use the Hypermode API key, navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys** in your
project dashboard. From there, you can copy your API key to a secure location to
be consumed by your app that is calling Hypermode.

## Rotate API Key

There might be times when you need to rotate your API key. This could be due to
a security breach, accidentally leaking your API key, and so on.

Before rotating your API key, navigate to **Settings** → **Auth** in your
project dasboard. Take note of the name of the `PEM key` with `hypermode-` as
the prefix. You will need to delete this as the final step of this process.

Next, navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**, and click on the `Rotate` button.
This will generate a new API key, and you can copy it to a secure location.

At this point, both the old and new API keys are valid. This is so that you can
update your app to use the new API key without incurring any downtime.

Once you have updated your app to use the new API key, navigate back to
**Settings** → **Auth**. You will notice that there are now two `PEM keys`, the
one you noted earlier, and the new one, also prefixed with `hypermode-`. You can
now safely delete the old one. This will invalidate the old API key.

## Bring Your Own Auth

As you may have known, Modus has its own [authentication](/modus/authentication)
features. So you can choose to implement your own auth, instead of using the
Hypermode API key.

To do this, navigate to **Settings** → **Auth** in your project dashboard. From
there, you can upload your own verification key either as a JWKS endpoint or in
PEM encoded format. This will be used to verify the JWTs sent to your Modus app.

At this point, you can safely delete the default Hypermode `PEM key` to disable
the Hypermode API key.
