title: AI Engineers World's Fair Workshop
description: "git push, get AI API"
---

In this workshop you’ll build a demo that augments an app with AI for classification, natural language search, and summarization. Then you’ll learn how to iteratively improve before and after shipping to prod. We’ll use Hypermode to move fast and reduce infra overhead. You’ll walk away with a greater intuition for when & how to integrate AI without refactoring.

If you need help at any point, please don't hesitate to ask.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, you'll need a GitHub account where you can create a new repo and [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/) or higher installed and activated.

You can install Node.js with any supported method, including:

- Downloading the official [prebuilt installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Using a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

## Agenda

We'll spend our time together on the following:

1. Playing a familiar game, using AI to scale
2. Understanding how the game is constructed, using both large and small models
3. Applying the same building blocks to an app triaging GitHub issues
4. Generalizing the concepts for adding AI to your apps
