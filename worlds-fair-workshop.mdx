title: AI Engineer World's Fair Workshop
description: "git push, get AI API"
---

In this workshop you'll build a demo that augments an app with AI for classification,
natural language search, and summarization. Then you'll learn how to iteratively improve
before and after shipping to prod. We'll use Hypermode to move fast and reduce infra overhead.
You'll walk away with a greater intuition for when & how to integrate AI without refactoring.

If you need help at any point, please don't hesitate to ask.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, you'll need:

- A GitHub account where you can create a new repo
- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/) or higher installed and activated.
- An IDE or text editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You can install Node.js with any supported method, including:

- Downloading the official [prebuilt installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Using a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

</Tip>

## Agenda

We'll spend our time together on the following:

1. Playing a familiar game, using AI to scale the format
2. Understanding how the game is constructed, using both large and small models
3. Applying the same building blocks to an app triaging GitHub issues
4. Generalizing the concepts for adding AI to your apps

## Hypercategories

We're going to first play a game called Hypercategories, a scaled-variant of the game
[Scattergories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories). In Scattergories, players
receive a list of categories and a letter. They have to come up with a unique word that
fits each category and starts with the given letter.

In Hypercategories, for each submission that matches the category and letter, you'll
receive a point. If other submissions match yours, you'll split the point.

### Let's play

When the game starts, scan the QR code or go to https://tinyurl.com/4mdhx29j

### AI-powered filtering and scoring

## GitHub issue triage

We're going to apply what we learned from Hypercategories to a real-world problem:
triaging GitHub issues. We'll build a tool that helps you quickly understand trends,
classify, and identify similar issues in their repos.

### Set up your project

Hypermode makes it easy to spin up new projects for experimentation.

- Go to [justship.ai](https://justship.ai) and select `GitHub Issue Triage`
- Click `Deploy` to start the onboarding flow
- Authenticate your account with GitHub and edit the repo name as needed
- Click `Create` to deploy your project

While your project is spinning up, personalize your workspace.

### Set up local environment

- Clone the newly created GitHub repository locally, using any method you prefer.

  For example, you can use the GitHub CLI:

  ```sh
  gh repo clone <your-repo-name>
  ```

  Or the Git CLI:

  ```sh
  git clone <your-repo-uri>
  ```

  Or you can use a graphical client like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

- Open the local repository in your IDE or text editor.

- Using a terminal window (preferably from within your IDE), open the `functions` directory,
  install dependencies, and build the project:

  ```sh
  cd functions
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

Hypermode Functions:
  classifyIssue(id: string, title: string, description: string): string
  trendSummary(owner: string, repo: string): string
```

</Accordion>

#### What just happened?

You compiled a Hypermode project written in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/),
a TypeScript-like language that compiles to WebAssembly for fast, secure, and efficient execution.

A successful compilation indicates that the resulting project is ready to deploy on Hypermode.
The Hypermode Functions listed in the output automatically become part of the project's GraphQL API.

In this case, you can see two functions:

- `classifyIssue` that takes an issue ID, title, and description and returns a classification label.
- `trendSummary` that takes a GitHub owner and repo and returns a summary of trends for that repo.

Since you created the project from a template, this version of the code is already deployed.
When you make any changes, simply commit and push back to the GitHub repository.
The changes deploy automatically using the GitHub Actions workflow set up in the project.

### Review and modify the code

For this next step of the workshop, we'll review the code of the Hypermode Functions
in the project and make some small modifications.

We'll start this together, as a group. Please follow along in your own project.

<Tip>
  If using VS Code, you may be seeing files and code underlined in red at this stage,
  even though the project built successfully. This is because the TypeScript language services
  aren't yet aware of the AssemblyScript dependency.

You can fix this by forcing a reset of the TypeScript language services, in any of these ways:

- You can close and reopen the project in VS Code.
- You can open the VS Code command pallette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows)
  and run the command `TypeScript: Restart TS server`.
- You can modify the `assembly/tsconfig.json` file by adding a comment or whitespace and saving it.
- On Linux or Mac, you can open a terminal and run `touch assembly/tsconfig.json`.

</Tip>

### Trend summarization

Have a look at the function `trendSummary` in [functions/assembly/trends.ts](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/ship-issue-triage/blob/main/functions/assembly/trends.ts)

The purpose of this function is to summarize the trends of the issues in a GitHub repository.

The function performs the following steps:

- Fetches the issues from the repository, using the GitHub REST API.
- Concatenates several pieces of information from each issue into a single string.
- Sends that string to an OpenAI model to generate a summary.
- Returns the summary as the output of the function.

<Accordion title="Code">

```ts
export function trendSummary(owner: string, repo: string): string {
  const issues = getGithubIssues(owner, repo);

  const summary = issues
    .map<string>(
      (issue) =>
        `${issue.createdAt} ${issue.user ? "From " + issue.user!.login : ""} : ${issue.title}`,
    )
    .join("\n");

  const model = models.getModel<OpenAIChatModel>("text-generator");
  const instruction = `Provide a summary of the trends in the repository based on the issues created.`;

  const input = model.createInput([
    new SystemMessage(instruction),
    new UserMessage(summary),
  ]);

  input.temperature = 0.7;

  const output = model.invoke(input);

  return output.choices[0].message.content.trim();
}
```

</Accordion>

### Issue type classification

Next let's examine the `classifyIssue` function in [functions/assembly/classify.ts](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/ship-issue-triage/blob/main/functions/assembly/classify.ts)

The purpose of this function is to classify an issue based on its title and description.

The function performs the following steps:

- Concatenates the title and description of the issue into a single string.
- Sends that string to a purpose-built classification model to classify the issue.
- Returns the classification label as the output of the function.

Along the way, it also logs some information to Hypermode that can be useful
for debugging and monitoring the function's behavior.

<Accordion title="Code">

```ts
export function classifyIssue(
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
): string {
  console.log(`Classifying issue ${id}`);
  const summary = `${title}\n${description}`;

  const model = models.getModel<ClassificationModel>("issue-classifier");
  const input = model.createInput([summary]);
  const output = model.invoke(input).predictions[0];

  console.log(`Issue ${id} classified as ${output.label}`);
  return output.label;
}
```

</Accordion>

#### Modify the function

As an exercise, let's modify the `classifyIssue` function to only return labels
that have a confidence score of a certain threshold or higher.

See if you can figure out how to do this. If you get stuck, ask for help,
or view the solution below.

<Accordion title="Code (Solution Spoiler)">

```ts
export function classifyIssue(
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
): string {
  console.log(`Classifying issue ${id}`);
  const summary = `${title}\n${description}`;

  const model = models.getModel<ClassificationModel>("issue-classifier");
  const input = model.createInput([summary]);
  const output = model.invoke(input).predictions[0];

  // This is the new code that checks the confidence score.
  if (output.confidence < 0.6) {
    console.log(
      `Issue ${id} couldn't be classified. Confidence: ${output.confidence}`,
    );
    return "unknown";
  }

  console.log(`Issue ${id} classified as ${output.label}`);
  return output.label;
}
```

</Accordion>

#### Deploy the changes

Commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository, using any method you prefer.

For example, using the Git CLI:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add threshold to classification"
git push
```

#### Test the function

Using a web browser, sign in to hypermode.com and navigate to your project.
You can test the `classifyIssue` function with sample inputs using the GraphiQL
interface provided by the Hypermode UI.

### Issue similarity search

In order to find similar issues, we need to:

- Define a collection to store issues
- Create a function that knows how to compute vector embeddings
- Create a Hypermode function that uses the collection to find similar issues
- Deploy the code changes
- Insert issues data into the collection, and test the function

#### Define a collection

Open the `hypermode.json` (in the root of the repo directory) and add the following section:

```json
  "collections": {
    "issuesCollection": {
      "searchMethods": {
        "byTitle": {
          "embedder": "minilmEmbedder"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

This tells Hypermode to create a collection named `issuesCollection`,
and to search by title using an embedder function named `minilmEmbedder`.

In order to compute vector embeddings, we also need another model to be
declared in the `hypermode.json` file.

Add the following to the existing `"models"` section:

```json
    "minilm": {
      "sourceModel": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
      "host": "hypermode",
      "provider": "hugging-face"
    }
```

<Accordion title="Complete Manifest File">

The complete `hypermode.json` manifest file should now be as follows:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://manifest.hypermode.com/hypermode.json",

  "models": {
    "issue-classifier": {
      "sourceModel": "AntoineMC/distilbart-mnli-github-issues",
      "provider": "hugging-face",
      "host": "hypermode"
    },
    "text-generator": {
      "sourceModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "host": "openai",
      "path": "v1/chat/completions"
    },
    "minilm": {
      "sourceModel": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
      "host": "hypermode",
      "provider": "hugging-face"
    }
  },

  "hosts": {
    "github": {
      "baseUrl": "https://api.github.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{AUTH_TOKEN}}"
      }
    },
    "openai": {
      "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
      }
    }
  },

  "collections": {
    "issuesCollection": {
      "searchMethods": {
        "byTitle": {
          "embedder": "minilmEmbedder"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

#### Create the embedder function

Create a new file `embedder.ts` in the `functions/assembly` folder.

This function uses the MiniLM model to create vector embeddings for the input text.

```ts
import { models } from "@hypermode/functions-as";
import { EmbeddingsModel } from "@hypermode/models-as/models/experimental/embeddings";

export function minilmEmbedder(text: string[]): f32[][] {
  const model = models.getModel<EmbeddingsModel>("minilm");
  const input = model.createInput(text);
  const output = model.invoke(input);

  return output.predictions;
}
```

You'll also need to modify the `functions/assembly/index.ts` file to export the new function.

Add the following line to the end of the file:

```ts
export * from "./embedder";
```

#### Create the search function

Create a new file `similar.ts` in the `functions/assembly` folder.

This function uses the collection to search for similar issues based on the title.

```ts
import { collections } from "@hypermode/functions-as";

// Define the structure we expect for the output of the similarity search function.
@json
class SimilarIssue {
  id!: string;
  title!: string;
  similarity!: f64;
}

export function similarIssues(title: string): SimilarIssue[] {
  const response = collections.search(
    "issuesCollection",
    "byTitle",
    title, // the text to search for
    3, // return the top 3 results
    true, // include text in the results
  );

  return response.objects.map<SimilarIssue>(
    (o) =>
      <SimilarIssue>{
        id: o.key,
        title: o.text,
        similarity: o.score,
      },
  );
}
```

You'll also need to modify the `functions/assembly/index.ts` file to export the new function.

Add the following line to the end of the file:

```ts
export * from "./similar";
```

#### Deploy the changes

Commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository, using any method you prefer.

For example, using the Git CLI:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add similarity search"
git push
```

#### Insert issues data into the collection

In the Hypermode UI, navigate to your project and find the collection named `issuesCollection`.

Click the `Upload` link and upload a CSV file containing the issues data.

**TODO: provide a sample CSV file**

Alternatively, you can add the data programmatically.
For example, you can create a new function that inserts data directly into
the collection.

```ts
export function addIssue(id: string, title: string): string {
  const result = collections.upsert("issuesCollection", id, title);
  return result.status;
}
```

#### Test the function

Like before, you can navigate to your project at hypermode.com and test the `similarIssues`
function with sample inputs using the GraphiQL interface provided by the Hypermode UI.

### Production-ready API

As you've seen, Hypermode makes it easy to build and deploy AI-powered functions.

When you're ready to take the next step, you can start incorporating these functions
into your own applications. Hypermode provides a GraphQL API that you can use to
interact with your functions. You can obtain an API key from the settings page
in the Hypermode UI, then use any GraphQL tool or client library you wish.

## What's next

You can apply the building blocks of filtering, summarization, categorization, and search
into a wide variety of applications. Hypermode makes it easy to iterate on your AI features.
