title: AI Engineers World's Fair Workshop
description: "git push, get AI API"
---

In this workshop you’ll build a demo that augments an app with AI for classification, natural language search, and summarization. Then you’ll learn how to iteratively improve before and after shipping to prod. We’ll use Hypermode to move fast and reduce infra overhead. You’ll walk away with a greater intuition for when & how to integrate AI without refactoring.

If you need help at any point, please don't hesitate to ask.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, you'll need

- a GitHub account where you can create a new repo
- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/) or higher installed and activated.
- an IDE such as VS Code

You can install Node.js with any supported method, including:

- Downloading the official [prebuilt installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Using a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

<Tip>
  Join the conversation on the [AI Engineer
  Slack](https://ai-engineer-workspace.slack.com/archives/C079FEPGY69).

## Agenda

We'll spend our time together on the following:

1. Playing a familiar game, using AI to scale
2. Understanding how the game is constructed, using both large and small models
3. Applying the same building blocks to an app triaging GitHub issues
4. Generalizing the concepts for adding AI to your apps

## Hypergories

### Let's play

### AI-powered filtering and scoring

## GitHub issue triage

### Set up your project

- visit [justship.ai](https://justship.ai/)
- select ???

### Set up local environment

- clone the newly created GitHub repository locally.
  From the repository folder:

```sh
cd functions
npm install
npm run build
```

The build output is as follow:

```
> functions@1.2.0 build
> node ./node_modules/@hypermode/functions-as/bin/build-plugin.js

Building functions@1.2.0 in debug mode...

Plugin Metadata:
  Plugin Name:     functions@1.2.0
  Library:         @hypermode/functions-as@0.9.1
  Build ID:        cptjdhnr043kifof248g
  Build Timestamp: 2024-06-25T21:29:42.152Z
  Git Repo:        https://github.com/hypermodeAI/ship-issue-triage
  Git Commit:      b40ec3e5076acaf7f53b2c3dd9c78c34d04b376a

Hypermode Functions:
  addIssue(id: string, title: string): string
  addSpam(id: string, title: string): string
  classifyIssue(id: string, title: string): string
  embedIssue(text: string[]): f32[][]
  isSpam(title: string): f32
  similarIssues(title: string): SimilarIssue[]
  trendSummary(owner: string, repo: string, since: string): string

Custom Data Types:
  SimilarIssue { id: string, title: string, similarity: f64 }
```

**What just happened?**

- Hypermode compiled the assembly scripts form our project and create a wasm module ready to be deployed on Hypermode.
- Every function exported from `index.ts` became an `Hypermode function` and will appear in the project GraphQL API.

At this stage, you can see

```
  classifyIssue(id: string, title: string): string
  trendSummary(owner: string, repo: string, since: string): string
```

**Note**
If using VS Code and see files in errors, you may need to force a reset of the typescript.

```sh
touch assembly/tsconfig.json
```

You will:

- review the code of `trendSummary` function
- review and change the function `issueClassification`
- add a new function `similarIssues`

### Trend summarization

```
code here
```

### Classify issue type

### Find similar issues
