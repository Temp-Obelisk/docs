title: AI Engineers World's Fair Workshop
description: "git push, get A(P)I"
---

In this workshop you’ll build a demo that augments an app with AI for classification, natural language search, and summarization. Then you’ll learn how to iteratively improve before and after shipping to prod. We’ll use Hypermode to move fast and reduce infra overhead. You’ll walk away with a greater intuition for when & how to integrate AI without refactoring.

If you need help at any point, please don't hesitate to ask.
