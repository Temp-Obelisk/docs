Hypermode leverages a native GitHub integration for the deployment of Hypermode projects. The deployment includes both the project's [manifest](/manifest) and functions.

<Note>
  Preview environments for live validation of pull requests are in development.

## Build

The [template project](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/template-project) includes a GitHub Action to build your project's functions. On success, the action deploys your functions to Hypermode when committing or merging to the branch defined in the Hypermode Console.

## Deploy

On successful build of your project or a change to your manifest in your connected GitHub repository, Hypermode automatically deploys your project changes.

For [auto-deployed models](/define-models#auto-deployed-models), Hypermode deploys a dedicated instance of the model.

## Serve

Once deployed, your project will be reachable through the API endpoint specified in the Hypermode Console. This endpoint is protected by an API Token which
can be accessed through the Settings page. You will need to pass this token in the `Authorization` request header (`Authorization: Bearer {{API_TOKEN}}`).
