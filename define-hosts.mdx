title: Define Hosts
description: "Securely connect to your data"
---

Hosts establish connectivity for AI models and other external endpoints.
The `hosts` object in the [project manifest](/manifest) allows you to define hosts, for secure access from within a function.

```json hypermode.json
{
  "hosts": {
    "openai": {
      "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each host requires a unique name, specified as a key, containing only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

<Note>
You must include either a `baseUrl` or an `endpoint` (not both).
</Note>

<Warning>
Don't include secrets directly in the manifest!

If your host requires authentication, you can specify `headers` and/or `queryParameters` properties.
Those values can include _placeholders_ which resolve to their respective secrets at runtime.
The secrets themselves are set via the Hypermode Console, where they're securely stored until needed.
</Warning>

## Properties

<ResponseField name="baseUrl" type="string" required>
  Base URL for connections to the host.
  - Must end with a trailing slash.
  - May contain path segments if necessary.

  Example: `"https://api.example.com/v1/"`

  _If providing the entire URL, use the `endpoint` field instead._
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint" type="string" required>
  Full URL endpoint for connections to the host.

  Example: `"https://models.example.com/v1/classifier"`
  
  _If providing only the base of the URL, use the `baseUrl` field instead._
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="headers" type="object">
  If provided, these headers are used in all requests to the host. Each key-value pair is a header name and value.

  Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which resolve at runtime to secrets
  provided for each host, via the Hypermode Console.

  <Accordion title="Examples">

  This example specifies a header named `Authorization` that uses the `Bearer` scheme, where the token is provided by a secret named `AUTH_TOKEN`:
  ```json
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{AUTH_TOKEN}}"
  }
  ```

  This example specifies a header named `X-API-Key` that is provided by a secret named `API_KEY`:
  ```json
  "headers": {
    "X-API-Key": "{{API_KEY}}"
  }
  ```

  You can use a special syntax for hosts that require [HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
  In this example, secrets named `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` are combined and then base64-encoded to form a compliant `Authorization` header value:
  ```json
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Basic {{base64(USERNAME:PASSWORD)}}"
  }
  ```

  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="queryParameters" type="object">
  If provided, these parameters appended to the URL for all requests to the host.  Each key-value pair is a parameter name and value.

  Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which are resolved at runtime to secrets
  provided for each host, via the Hypermode Console.

  <Accordion title="Example">

  This example specifies a query parameter named `key` that is provided by a secret named `API_KEY`:
  ```json
  "queryParameters": {
    "key": "{{API_KEY}}"
  }
  ```

  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>
